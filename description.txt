This mod stops tombstones from appearing when you die.
Based on the "Disable Gravestones" option from HERO's Mod.

Changelog:
1.1.1:
* Changed the mod back to be both sided, since client side mods aren't loaded by servers (oops).
* Changed the config to be server sided (should work the same in single player), and made the settings only changeable by the server in MP.
1.1.0:
* Updated to tModLoader 0.11.8.1
* Added config option to allow dropping tombs from town NPC deaths, should work exactly like in 1.4 Hardcore mode
* Changed how tombs are prevented from dropping on player death so that mods that use the tombstone projectile aren't affected
1.0.2:
* Updated to tModLoader 0.11
* Updated config system to use ModConfig
* Now a client-side mod
1.0.1:
* Added config file
* Added no death text option, defaults to false
